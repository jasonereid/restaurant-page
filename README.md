# Project Description
This project is designed to show my use of a Node.js/Express backend coupled with an HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap 5 frontend in a simple, single page restaurant website. The core of this project is simple- a single page informative website to point customers to a business that can be built in just a few days.

It features a few of the fancier options easily implemented via Bootstrap, like the rotating image carousel or the off canvas menus that flyout from the left side.

# Project Description
This project is designed to show my use of a Node.js/Express backend coupled with an HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap 5 frontend in a simple, single page restaurant website. The core of this project is simple- a single page informative website to point customers to a business that can be built in just a few days.

It features a few of the fancier options easily implemented via Bootstrap, like the rotating image carousel or the off canvas menus that flyout from the left side.

Everything is run through app.js. This is hosted on a linux VM (Ubuntu), but you can run it on windows just as easily.
Node gets everything up and running and serves the files.
Express serves as the app framework and exposes the main directory and the /images folder.
Boostrap CDN provides some CSS and basic JavaScript functionality for appearance.
There is some custom CSS in the images/style.css file.

# How to install and run
